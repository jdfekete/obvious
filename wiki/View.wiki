The toolkit contains one interface for its view part and currently one abstract class supporting views based on Swing. More abstract classes could follow based on other computer graphics library (OpenGL...).

= View =

View interface is mainly a tag, it provides few methods. This interface mainly ensures listener's support (add, remove and get).

In obvious, view implementations are intended to be specialized for a particular computer graphics library in an abstract class, like JView (see next session).

= JView =

JView is an abstract class implementing View interface. This class is dedicated to the Swing library. It simply adds an abstract method to return a JComponent corresponding to the component containing the obvious view.

= ViewListener =

ViewListener is an interface. It tags a listener implementation dedicated to an obvious view.

#summary This page describes the obviousx package.

= Introduction =

Obviousx is a complementary package, named in the same way as the javax package of Sun. It introduces support functions for all obvious bindings. Each subpackage of Obvious will be described below.


= obviousx =

The obviousx root package only contains two exception classes:

 * _ObviousxException_: class used for exceptions directly created by obviousx mechanism.
 * _ObviousxRuntimeException_: class extending RuntimeException, it is mainly used to encapsulate exception generated by dependancies of obviousx.


== obviousx.io ==

This package contains several interfaces defining reader for Network and Table Obvious objects and corresponding writers. Three interfaces are defined:

 * _Exporter_: this interface is meant to be used when creating a writer. By calling the createFile() method an output file corresponding to the written Obvious data structure must be created. This interface assumes the use of Java Format and the Obvious introduced interface FormatFactory (presented below) to handle Java objects conversion to String.
 * _GraphImporter_: this interface is meant to be used when reading a file describing a graph that the user wants to import as an Obvious Network. By calling the loadGraph() method an output Obvious Network corresponding to the read file must be created. This interface assumes the use of Java Format and the Obvious introduced interface FormatFactory (presented below) to handle String conversion to Java objects.
 * _TableImporter_: this interface is meant to be used when reading a file describing tabular data that the user wants to import as an Obvious Table. By calling the loadTable() method an output Obvious Table corresponding to the read file must be created. This interface assumes the use of Java Format and the Obvious introduced interface FormatFactory (presented below) to handle String conversion to Java objects.

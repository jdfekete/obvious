#summary Compilation guide for Obvious Project.

= Introduction =

Each Obvious implementation is a Maven Project. So, in a maven environment, maven will resolve with the pom.xml file all the dependancies and build the correct java classpath.

= Details =

For a minimal development environment you need to the following setup. An environment using Eclipse with the Maven and Subversion plugins is assumed, but any setup supporting Maven and Subversion should do. A minimal setup consists of InfoVisToolkit, Obvious, ObviousX and one of the components such as Obvious-Prefuse.

  # Checkout of the InfoVisToolkit from https://ivtk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ivtk/trunk/infovis. Although this package is set as a dependency in obviousx, it is not available through the Maven repositories at the moment.
  # Checkout the Obvious interfaces from http://obvious.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/obvious.
  # Checkout the Obvious utils from http://obvious.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/obviousx
  # Checkout an Obvious component e.g. http://obvious.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/obvious-prefuse

Each of these can be checked out as a separate project in Eclipse. The Maven build framework will retrieve all remaining dependencies.

Unlike the data model, during the workshop, no consensus emerged concerning the Visualization and View models in Obvious. The main reason is that currently different approaches exist among toolkits : the monolithic and the polylithic approaches. So, for the moment, there is no way to create an abstract layer for visualization as we did for the data model. Further discussions and workshop may address this problem.

However, we propose a solution to address this problem for monolithic toolkits. We propose to wrap monolithic components in a black box fed by an Obvious data structure and a map of parameters allowing to configure the component. For example, it is possible to indicate the X and Y axis columns for a scatter-plot. If a developer needs a non existing visualization component, it simply adds to choose an implementation toolkit and to create, then this new visualization will be compatible with all data models: our solution does not generate extra costs of development.

Concerning the view, we choose to implement a simplified version of the camera pattern introduced in [2]. The black box concept is still present : a view simply wraps a view component of a targeted toolkit.

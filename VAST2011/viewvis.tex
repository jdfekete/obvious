Unlike the data model, during the workshop~\cite{vismaster2008}, no consensus emerged concerning the Visualization and View models. The main reason is that currently different approaches exist among toolkits : the monolithic and the polylithic approaches. So, for the moment, there is no way to create an abstract layer for visualization as we did for the data model. Further discussions and workshops may address this problem.

However, we design a solution to address this problem for monolithic toolkits. We propose to wrap monolithic components in a black box fed by an Obvious data structure and a map of parameters allowing configuration of the component. For example, it is possible to indicate the X and Y axis columns for a scatter-plot. If a developer needs a non-existing visualization component, it simply adds the choice of an implementation toolkit to create it, then this new visualization will be compatible with all data models. Our solution does not generate extra costs of development.

\jo{Can we sure about the last sentence above?. The discussion of Prefuse in 6.1 is an example of this, but requires the user of Prefuse to develop new visualization components and wrap them in Obvious. This seems like an 'extra cost of development' to me.}
\pierreluc{Wrap them in Obvious is pretty easy (about ten lines of code). So yes, there is a tiny extra cost of development.}

An Obvious visualization works with all implementation of Obvious data structure. For existing implementations such as Obvious Prefuse or Obvious JUNG, Visualization component uses obviousx package to wrap Obvious table to native data structures of original toolkit of the Visualization. This mechanism avoids copying data from one structure to another an important point for visual analytics. However, Obvious also provides a default mechanism to quickly translate and synchronize one Obvious data structure from a targeted toolkit to an Obvious structure for another  toolkit when no wrapper has been defined in obviousx for a specific toolkit.

Concerning the view, we choose to implement a simplified version of the camera pattern introduced in \cite{DesignPatternsIV} to support standard operations such as zoom and pan. The black box concept is still present : a view simply wraps a view component of a targeted toolkit completing our monolithic pipeline for the visualization.

\jo{The assertion made in this section suggests that the mono/poly-lithic approaches that vary between existing toolkits have less of an impact on data models than on view models. We should probably make some reference to this distinction in Section 2 so that it does not look like we simply ran out of time in the workshop to consider standardization of view models.}

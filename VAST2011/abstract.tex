\abstract{
This article describes ``Obvious'': a meta-toolkit that abstracts and
encapsulates information visualization toolkits implemented in the
Java language. It intends to unify their use and postpone the choice
of which concrete toolkit(s) to use later-on in the development of
visual analytics applications.  We also report on the lessons we have
learned when wrapping popular toolkits with Obvious, namely Prefuse,
the InfoVis Toolkit, partly Improvise, JUNG and other data management
libraries.  We show several examples on the uses of Obvious, how the
different toolkits can be combined, for instance sharing their data
models.  We also show how Weka \new{and RapidMiner, two} popular
machine-learning toolkit\new{s}, have been wrapped with Obvious and can be
used directly with all the other wrapped toolkits.

We expect Obvious to start a co-evolution process: Obvious is meant to
evolve when more components of Information Visualization systems will
become consensual. It is also designed to help information
visualization systems adhere to the best practices to provide a higher
level of interoperability and leverage the domain of visual analytics.

We have presented Obvious, a meta-toolkit whose goal is to facilitate
the development of Visual Analytics applications.
Obvious provides concrete, immediate benefits to Visual Analytics
application programmers: it improves reusability and interoperability
of code and software components, and defers the choice of the which
toolkit(s) to use to a later stage of the Visual Analytics application
and provides bridges between tools instead of another competing
toolkit.  It also allows toolkit and library developers to integrate
their tool into the rich environment of Obvious-compatible systems.
It exposes programmers to state of the art design patterns as well as
a wealth of convenience features.  Overall, we believe it clarifies
and simplifies the implementation of Visual Analytics system.

Obvious shall remain a work in progress by design, at least in the
foreseeable future.  All members of the Visual Analytics community are
invited to contribute to its design, make it evolve, and of course to
use it.


We have presented Obvious, a meta-toolkit whose goal is, ultimately, to consolidate the experience acquired by multiple toolkit designers and contributors into a single tool. Obvious provides concrete, immediate benefits to both toolkits designers and users: it dispenses the former from reimplementing various mechanisms which are outside their core concerns and helps them give visibility to their work by integrating it into a global context. It enables the later (users) to delay their choice of toolkit, be faced upfront with state of the art design patterns as well as a wealth of convenience features. The longer term benefits shall reach deeper prospects: possibly defragmenting a research area by providing bridges between tools rather than yet another, competing, toolkit. If this goal is successfully reached, then the reward shall benefit the whole infovis community, enabling it to provide its user communities an easier entry path. \emph{note from tb: it's getting late, I'm not sure I can articulate my thoughts...}

Obvious whall remain a work in progress by design, at least in the foreseeable future. All members of the infoviz community are invited to contribute to its design, make it evolve, and possibly use its features. While Obvious may not yet be at a stage where it can be diffused much beyond, this shall come soon. We hope it will prove a valuable service to the infoviz community.
